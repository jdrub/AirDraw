AirDraw
=======

This should build fine with Gradle.  Upon running it will push all motion data to Firebase (no permissions...anyone can push data).  To view run the html file in the demo-html5 directory.

TODO
====
- Clear Firebase data (for that phone) on each app launch, so we don't need to manually erase each time.
